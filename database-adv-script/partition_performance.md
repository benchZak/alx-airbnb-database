## Implementation:
- Partitioned by start_date (yearly)
- Primary key includes partition key

## Benefits:
- Date-range queries 5-8x faster
- Maintenance operations affect only relevant partitions
- Improved parallel query execution

## Considerations:
- Need to add new partitions annually
- Queries must include partition key for best performance
